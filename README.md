 2. based on the plays she loved the average donations were $40
 3. The mean Goal for successful campaigns was 5,000 compared to 10,000 for failed ones, inferring that failed campaigns tend to have higher goals.


###Recomendations:
Adjust play budget to 5,000 since its a reasonable goal based on the data. Most succesful campaigns started in May and lasted around a month, but if may isnt possible June and July are also good months to strive for. Absolutely avoid trying to start campaign in October, most failed campigns started this month.
